## <a name="developing"></a> Developing

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 10+ and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) 1.9.4 installed

### Project structure

This is a multi-package repository which uses [lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) for package task management and publishing.

- `docs/`: contains documentation templates
- `examples/`: contains simple examples of usage
- `plugins/`: contains plugin packages
- `packages/picasso.js`: contains the main `picasso.js` package
- `scripts/`: contains build scripts
- `test/`: contains test configs
- `website/`: contains source code for the picasso.js website

### Building

To install and build all packages run:

```sh
$ yarn
$ yarn run build
```

This will generate UMD packages for:

- the main package under `/packages/picasso.js/dist`
- each plugin under `/plugins/*/dist`

### Development workflow

- `yarn run build` generates UMD bundles for all packages
- `yarn run lint` checks code style
- `yarn run test` runs all tests

## <a name="git"></a> Git Guidelines

Generally, development should be done directly towards the `master` branch.

### Workflow

1. Fork and clone the repository

   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME/picasso.js.git
   ```

1. Create a branch in the fork

   The branch should be based on the `master` branch in the master repository.

   ```sh
   git checkout -b my-feature-or-bugfix master
   ```

1. Commit changes on your branch

   Commit changes to your branch, following the commit message format.

   ```sh
   git commit -m "fix: properly formatted SET statements."
   ```

1. Push the changes to your fork

   ```sh
   git push -u myfork my-feature-or-bugfix
   ```

1. Create a Pull Request

   > Before creating a Pull Request, make sure to sign the [CLA](#cla)

   In the Github UI of your fork, create a Pull Request to the `master` branch of the master repository.

   If the branch has merge conflicts or has been outdated, please do a rebase against the `master` branch.

### <a name="commit"></a> Commit message guidelines

Commit messages should follow the [commit message convention](https://conventionalcommits.org/).

#### Type

Should be one of the following:

- **build:** Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
- **chore:** Changes to build and dev processes/tools
- **ci:** Changes to the CI configuration files and scripts
- **docs:** Changes to documentation
- **feat:** A new feature
- **fix:** A bug fix
- **perf:** A code change that improves performance
- **refactor:** Changes to production code that is neither a new feature nor a bug fix
- **revert:** Reverts a previous commit
- **style:** Changes to code style formatting (white space, commas etc)
- **test:** Changes in test cases of production code

#### Scope

The `<scope>` of the commit is optional and can be omitted. When used though, it should describe the place or part of the project, e.g. `docs(examples)`, `feat(data)` etc.
